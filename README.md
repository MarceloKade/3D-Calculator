### Presentation

This is a 3D calculator project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator has basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as percentage and fractional numbers. There is also a sound that is activated after double-clicking on the same key, and is deactivated in the same way.

### Objective

Apply basic web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In order to explore new features within these technologies. Learn more at: [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

### What I Learned

#### CSS

- This project provided me with an opportunity to deepen my knowledge in web development, especially regarding the use of CSS properties "display: flex" and "display: grid" to create responsive layouts. Additionally, I was able to learn how to use shadow effects to give a three-dimensional appearance to the calculator.

- Through the manipulation of these properties and effects, I was able to efficiently and professionally style the calculator, highlighting operation buttons and numbers. To complete the realistic appearance of the calculator, I implemented an animation that simulates the effect of pressing a key when the user clicks on it.

- This project was a valuable experience for my development as a programmer and allowed me to apply the knowledge I gained in courses and tutorials in a practical way.

#### JS

- This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge using advanced concepts of object-oriented programming to define the behavior of the calculator.

- The code uses the HTML DOM to update the display of numbers and calculations, allowing users to interact with the calculator through the graphical interface.

- The calculator also allows users to use the keyboard to perform operations, in addition to the buttons on the graphical interface.
